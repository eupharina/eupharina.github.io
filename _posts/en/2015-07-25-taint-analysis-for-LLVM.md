In the paper, taint analysis problem is considered. To solve it, static interprocedural context-, flow-, and object-sensitive algorithm is proposed. Characteristics of the algorithm are evaluated, and specific features of the implementation of the algorithm on the basis of the LLVM compiler infrastructure are discussed. Results of evaluation are presented.
